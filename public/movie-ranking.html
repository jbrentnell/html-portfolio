 <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087056/?ref_=tt_mlt_tt_i_3">A Christmas Carol</a></h3>
 <p>This is the one with George C. Scott as Scrooge.</p>

 <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a></h3>
 <p>Action packed.  And continually makes you think about the nature of reality.</p>

 <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241527/">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</a></h3>
 <p>The movie that started the entire series.  Cute and innocent.</p>
